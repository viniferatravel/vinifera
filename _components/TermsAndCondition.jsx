Since, grant / non-grant of VISA and also communication of information in respect of grant / non-grant of VISA is beyond the control of Vinifera, the guest should be mentally prepared for any mental / physical dismay as a result of non-grant of VISA and / or delayed communication which may be just before departure of the tour or on the tour itself.</p>
